# Anomaly-Detection-in-Transactions-
Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour. 
# Introduction
Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various businesses, especially those dealing with financial transactions, online activities, and security-sensitive operations. We can follow a systematic process to address the challenge of anomaly detection. We can begin by collecting and preparing transaction data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. Then, we can find patterns in the data to find anomalies and use specialized anomaly detection algorithms like isolation forest to detect anomalies.
# Features
The dataset contains information about various financial transactions, each represented by several features:
1. Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Transaction_Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
3. Transaction_Volume: The quantity or number of items/actions involved in the transaction.
4. Average_Transaction_Amount: The historical average transaction amount for the account.
5. Frequency_of_Transactions: How often transactions are typically performed by the account.
6. Time_Since_Last_Transaction: Time elapsed since the last transaction.
7. Day_of_Week: The day of the week when the transaction occurred.
8. Time_of_Day: The time of day when the transaction occurred.
9. Age: Age of the account holder.
10. Gender: Gender of the account holder.
11. Income: Income of the account holder.
12. Account_Type: Type of account (e.g., personal, business).
# Usage
Python, Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
Here we are training an anomaly detection model using the Isolation Forest algorithm. First, we selected the relevant features for detection, namely Transaction_Amount, Average_Transaction_Amount, and Frequency_of_Transactions. We split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y), where X contains the selected features and y contains the binary labels indicating whether an instance is an anomaly or not. Then, we further split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split ratio. Next, we created an Isolation Forest model with a specified contamination parameter of 0.02 (indicating the expected ratio of anomalies) and a random seed for reproducibility. The model is then trained on the training set (X_train). So this is how you can perform anomaly detection in transactions using Machine Learning and Python. Anomaly detection in transactions means identifying unusual or unexpected patterns within transactions or related activities. These patterns, known as anomalies or outliers, deviate significantly from the expected norm and could indicate irregular or fraudulent behaviour.
